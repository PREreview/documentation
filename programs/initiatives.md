# PREreview Initiatives

At PREreview, we are dedicated to training a diverse community of reviewers, monitoring their progress and impact on the future of 
peer review. How will we achieve this goal? 

## Cohort-based peer review mentorship program (coming soon)  
We are developing a cohort-based peer-review mentorship program based on the successful 
[Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/). Researchers with little to no experience 
in peer review will be paired with more experienced reviewers and invited to engage in community calls, webinars, and one-to-one calls. 
The curriculum includes critical evaluation of preprints, strategies to help researchers provide constructive feedback, and training in unconscious bias, licensing, and leadership. 

 We are currently working with our community to learn how this program can support researchers from under-represented groups. If you are 
  interested in learning more, be considered as a mentor or a mentee in our first cohort, or have suggestions on how to best achieve our
  goal, please email us at contact@prereview.org.

## Live-streamed preprint journal clubs (LivePREJCs)  
We continue to support live-streamed preprint journal clubs, topic-centered, interactive preprint journal clubs that are 
live-streamed via videoconference. These events are designed to be inclusive of all researchers by allowing structured and 
constructive discussions around preprints and encouraging diverse methods of participation. Researchers from all over the world 
can join to build their network, meet globally-renowned experts, and collaborate on improving a preprint. Learn more about this program 
[here](https://github.com/fathomlabs/prereview-standup/blob/master/server/docs/LivePREJC.md).
