# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge  
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to making participation 
in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender 
identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We believe it is our duty as scientists at any level of our career to contribute to scientific evaluation in the form of peer review. 
PREreview provides a space for any researcher, independently of their career level, to provide feedback to emerging scientific output. We strive to build and support a community of PREreviewers who provide constructive feedback, because we are convinced that one can be honest AND respectful at the same time.  

## Our Responsibilities  
The PREreview team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and is expected to take appropriate and fair 
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.  

The PREreview team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, and other contributions that are not aligned 
to this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, 
threatening, offensive, or harmful. 

## Who does this Code of Conduct apply to?
This Code of Conduct applies to PREreview members contributing directly on this platform or members/non-members participating in events organized by PREreview (workshop, live-streamed preprint journal clubs, community calls, etc.).

## Reporting Code of Conduct violations
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported personally by contacting the PREreview leadership team at **[contact@prereview.org](contact@prereview.org)**, or anonymously by filling out **[this anonymous form](https://forms.gle/a4x3TX2D2XRRN7Wo6)**. 

An example of unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to, a rude and/or destructive comment appearing in a PREreview (see below for more examples of unacceptable behavior). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The PREreview team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the person that reports an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
PREreview members who do not follow and PREreview team members who do not enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary 
or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

**Example behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment include:**

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Providing feedback that is constructive, *i.e.*, useful to the receiver (see more below)
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

**Examples of unacceptable behaviors by participants include:**

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Providing unconstructive or disruptive feedback on PREreview
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Conflict of Interest/Competing interest
What is considered conflict of interest (CoI) at PREreview and why should you care about them?

CoI comes in many shapes and forms. In general, as defined on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest), a CoI emerges when "a person or organization is involved in multiple interests, financial or otherwise, and serving one interest could involve working against another."

In the context of peer review, PLoS refers to it as competing interest and defines it as follows [PLoS Reviewer Center](http://reviewers.plos.org/resources/competing-interests-for-reviewers/):  

*"A competing interest is anything that interferes with, or could reasonably be perceived as interfering with, the full and objective presentation and PREreview of a published preprint."*

A competing interest can be financial or non-financial, professional, or personal. It can arise in relationship to an organization, a department, a laboratory, or a person.

Competing interests matter because they can introduce perceived or actual bias in the evaluation of the preprint that can have repercussions all the way to the journal acceptance of that manuscript. 

To read more about competing interests in peer review, please refer to the [PLoS Reviewer Center's resources](http://reviewers.plos.org/resources/competing-interests-for-reviewers/). They provide a very useful checklist for you to self-evaluate your possible competing interest in relation to a manuscript you wish to review or comment. 

**If you find that you have a potential conflict with the authors, or the organization to which the author(s) is affiliated, please do disclose it in your PREreview. A failure in disclosing a competing interest is considered a violation of the PREreview Code of Conduct and will be treated accordingly.**
