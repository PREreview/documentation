# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge  
In the interest of fostering an open and  welcoming environment we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to making participation 
in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender 
identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We believe it is our duty as scientists at any level of our career to contribute to scientific evaluation in the form of peer review. 
PREreview provides a space for any researcher, independently of their career level, to provide feedback to emerging scientific output. We strive to build and support a community of PREreviewers who provide constructive feedback, because we are convinced that one can be honest AND respectful at the same time.  

## Our Responsibilities  
The PREreview team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair 
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.  

The PREreview team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, and other contributions that are not aligned 
to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, 
threatening, offensive, or harmful. 

## Who does this Code of Conduct apply to?
This Code of Conduct applies to PREreview members contributing directly on this platform or members/non-members participating in events organized by PREreview (workshop, live-streamed preprint journal clubs, community calls, etc.).


## Reporting
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported personally by contacting the PREreview leadership team at contact@prereview.org, or anonymously by filling out this form. 
An example of unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to, a rude and/or destructive comment appearing in a PREreview. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will  result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The PREreview team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
PREreview members who do not follow and PREreview team members who do not enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary 
or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

### Example behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Providing feedaback that is constructive*, i.e., useful to the receiver
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

### Examples of unacceptable behaviors by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Providing unconstructive or destruptive feedback on PREreview
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Preprint Journal Club Code of Conduct
To encourage a respectful and thriving preprint JC environment, we have provided additional pointers that we strongly recommend for hosting and participating in local and online (live-streamed) preprint JCs.

### Points to consider when organizing a preprint JC

* Before each journal club meets, allow an anonymous vote in which all participants have the opportunity to express any discomfort or conflict of interest related to reviewing a particular preprint. One vote against the preprint is sufficient to veto that preprint for discussion at the JC. This will help to create a safe environment for all your JC participants.
* Note-taking should be encouraged for all participants. However, we recommend that you assign one primary note-taker for each JC and have a system to rotate this responsibility across all JC members so that stereotypes, for example, that women should take notes, do not permeate this process. 
* Responsiblity for hosting the preprint JC should rotate between all members of the JC, and this should be scheduled well in advance to allow for preparation. 
* All contributions to the PREreview should be acknowledged, if desired by the contributor, within the PREreview. What constitutes authorship should be pre-determined prior to compiling the review.

### Points to consider when participating in a preprint JC

* Be respectful of other participant's contributions and do not dismiss their comments in an aggressive manner
* Acknowledge and amplify constructive comments that have been overlooked
* Be aware when you or others are dominating the discussing and allow space for other participants to contribute
