# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge  
In the interest of fostering an open and  welcoming environment we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to making participation 
in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender 
identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We believe it is our duty as scientists at any level of our career to contribute to scientific evaluation in the form of peer review. 
PREreview provides a space for any researcher, independently of their career level, to provide feedback to emerging scientific output. We strive to build and support a community of PREreviewers who provide constructive feedback, because we are convinced that one can be honest AND respectful at the same time.  

## Our Responsibilities  
The PREreview team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair 
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.  

The PREreview team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, and other contributions that are not aligned 
to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, 
threatening, offensive, or harmful. 

## Who does this Code of Conduct apply to?
This Code of Conduct applies to PREreview members contributing directly on this platform or members/non-members participating in events organized by PREreview (workshop, live-streamed preprint journal clubs, community calls, etc.).

## Reporting Code of Conduct violations
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported personally by contacting the PREreview leadership team at **[contact@prereview.org](contact@prereview.org)**, or anonymously by filling out [this anonymous form](). 

An example of unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to, a rude and/or destructive comment appearing in a PREreview (see below for more examples of unacceptable behavior). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will  result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The PREreview team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
PREreview members who do not follow and PREreview team members who do not enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary 
or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

### Example behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Providing feedaback that is constructive*, i.e., useful to the receiver
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

### Examples of unacceptable behaviors by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Providing unconstructive or destruptive feedback on PREreview
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Constructive feedback

Giving feedback is hard. Doing so constructively can be even more challenging. But what does "constructive" mean in the context of PREreview? Does it mean that you can only express positive comments related to a study? No. With constructive feedback we refer to feedback that can be used by the authors to improve their manuscript. That includes providing negative feedback on the use of a statistical test for example, or on the interpretability of a particular bar plot. However, that same negative feedback has to be provided using respectful language and in a way to allow the authors to fix the problem.   

For example, if you believe a statistical test was used incorrectly, you may say:  

*"Statistical test XYZ should be used only if the data is distributed normally. The data presented in this preprint appear to be highly skewed to the left, and for that I would suggest the use of ABC test, a non-parametric version of XYZ which makes no assumption on the parameters of the distribution of the data. If the authors' choice of XYZ is motivated by a particular strategy or other non-obvious analytical constraints, I recommend the authors explicitely mention that in the Methods section justifying their choice accordingly."* – This is constructive!

as opposed to:  

*You have no idea of what they are doing and should go back to statistics 101.*" – This is a clear violation of the PREreview Code of Conduct.  

In the first version of the comment, you are providing your opinion and backing it up with a reason why you think that test is inappropriate. Furthermore, you are using "the authors ..." as subject of your sentences instead of "you ..." which helps depersonalize the feedback and keep the focus on the work.

In the second version of the comment, you are clearly attacking the author at a personal level and insulting their education, which is not only offensive, unprofessional, and a clear violation of the Code of Conduct, but it is also useless to the authors as it does not provide a way to improve the study.

As our friends at [PLoS](http://reviewers.plos.org/resources/how-to-write-a-peer-review/) say, try to follow the golden rule: "Write the type of review you’d want to receive if you were the author."

### Conflict of Interest


### Being on the receiving end of feedback



## Preprint Journal Club 
To encourage a respectful and thriving preprint JC environment, we have provided additional tips we strongly recommend you follow for hosting and participating in local and online (live-streamed) preprint JCs.

### Points to consider when organizing a preprint JC

* Before each journal club meets, allow an anonymous vote in which all participants have the opportunity to express any discomfort or conflict of interest related to reviewing a particular preprint. One vote against the preprint is sufficient to veto that preprint for discussion at the JC. This will help to create a safe environment for all your JC participants.
* Note-taking should be encouraged for all participants. However, we recommend that you assign one primary note-taker for each JC and have a system to rotate this responsibility across all JC members so that stereotypes, for example, that women should take notes, do not permeate this process. 
* Responsiblity for hosting the preprint JC should rotate between all members of the JC, and this should be scheduled well in advance to allow for preparation. 
* All contributions to the PREreview should be acknowledged, if desired by the contributor, within the PREreview. What constitutes authorship should be pre-determined prior to compiling the review.

### Points to consider when participating in a preprint JC

* Be respectful of other participant's contributions and do not dismiss their comments in an aggressive manner
* Acknowledge and amplify constructive comments that have been overlooked
* Be aware when you or others are dominating the discussing and allow space for other participants to contribute
