<h1 id="prereview-extended-peer-review-guidelines">PREreview extended peer review guidelines</h1>
<p>Below is a detailed guide to help you critically and constructively evaluate the selected preprint. For a quicker version of this guide, please select Template #1.</p>
<h2 id="overview-and-take-home-message">Overview and take-home message</h2>
<p>Write a short (1 paragraph) summary of what the main findings of the research were and how this work has moved the field forward.
This could take the following structure:
“<em>[First author]</em> et al. have made significant advances in <em>[x, y and z]</em> by showing that… In addition, they have bridged the gap in
our knowledge about how <em>[process i interacts with process ii]</em>. Although this work is of <em>[significant]</em> interest to the field, there
are some concerns that could be addressed in the next version. These are outlined below.”</p>
<h2 id="positive-feedback">Positive feedback</h2>
<p>As the aim of this PREreview is to support the authors by providing constructive feedback, the PREreviewer(s) should also
include positive remarks to encourage future posting of preprints. Remember, the authors are human too! To help guide you, here are a
few questions you might ask yourself after reading the preprint:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What result did you find the most interesting and why?</em>  </li>
<li><em>What did you learn from the study that really fascinated you?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Did you learn anything from this preprint that you would include in your future work? Examples could be a new technique,
a new way of approaching an idea, a certain way of interpreting the type of data, a good way of summarising the results,
the structure of the manuscript if it is clear and logical, etc.</em>  </li>
<li><em>What ideas for further research are based on the preprint? [Note: this encourages preprint authors for their early sharing
and promotes openness among reviewers as well.]</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<p>Next are your concerns. Remember you are writing to another human being, so be respectful and realistic. Also, if you are unsure about
something, be honest and say you are unsure. Don’t feel afraid to admit if you are not confident about your concerns, or part of the work
is out of your area of expertise.</p>
<h3 id="major-concerns">Major concerns:</h3>
<p>Here the reviewer(s) should list 2-3 major concerns about the research (if they exist). This may relate to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Does the title accurately reflect the results?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Experimental design: were the techniques appropriate for the hypothesis? Were suitable controls included?
Were new techniques/mutants/cell lines etc. sufficiently characterised to allow the study to be replicated? Were robust statistical
methods used?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Do the results support the authors’ conclusions and, if not, what additional experiments would you suggest?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Are there big flaws in the understanding of the current literature and interpretation of the literature that might undermine the
interpretation of the current results?</em>  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minor-concerns">Minor concerns:</h3>
<p>Here the PREreviewer(s) can mention 3-5 minor concerns that are not critical to the understanding and conclusions of the research, but would improve the overall flow or clarity of the manuscript. These concerns might include the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In general, was the manuscript easy to follow/did it have a logical flow? Were there a lot of typos that needed addressing?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Does the abstract provide a concise summary of the hypotheses and main results?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Were the methods sufficiently detailed to allow the experiments to be repeated?</em>  </li>
<li>*Were the figures clear and logically arranged? Were the figure legends sufficiently detailed to allow the figures to be understood without reading the main text?</li>
<li><em>Are the figures representative of the data described in the results section?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Did the authors make all their associated data openly available (e.g. sequencing data, coding)?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Did the discussion address how their results move the field forwards?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Were the citations thorough or were key references missing?</em>  </li>
</ul>
