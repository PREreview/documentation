<h1>How to write a PREreview</h1>
<p>At PREreview, we believe <em>all</em> researchers should be able to engage in honest and respectful conversations around emerging scientific
output. Peer review is a fundamental aspect of being a researcher. However, formal training in it is uncommon and varies in quality.</p>
<p>Our hope is that by engaging in open peer review of preprints, possibly collaboratively as a result of a discussion at journal club, researchers will have the chance to practice peer review in the safe and welcoming environment provided by PREreview, and learn from other openly shared PREreviews and comments.</p>
<p>Here are the 5 golden rules for a great PREreview:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Be respectful.</em> We are all human beings and we all make mistakes. The goal here is to help each other move knowledge and discovery forward and not make your peers feel diminished or personally attacked by disrespectful comments.   </li>
<li><em>Be constructive.</em> Similarly, you need to make sure feedback stays constructive and actionable so that preprint authors can easily respond to the feedback and possibly incorporate the constructive suggestions into the final publication.   </li>
<li><em>Be honest.</em> Being constructive does <em>not</em> mean you have to lie or only bring up positive comments. It means you have to write your suggestions in a way that is not insulting for the authors and that can lead to an easy incorporation of that feedback. Constructive negative comments followed by a rational and possibly examples/suggestions on how to improve the issue are welcome.  </li>
<li><em>Be clear.</em> The clearer you are about what your comment or suggestion is referring to, the easier it will be for authors and readers to understand it.   </li>
<li><em>Be concise.</em> You can be as thorough as you have time to be, but keeping your feedback concise increases the chances authors and other readers will read through it and take action as a result of it.  </li>
</ol>

<h2>PREreview Templates</h2>
<p>In order to help you write a PREreview, we have two basic templates you can load directly into the editing window when you write your PREreview. Below is the content of these two templates. Template 1 is a quick questionnaire you can copy and paste in a collaborative document during journal club, for example, or load to guide you in the review process. Template 2 is a guide for a more detailed report you might want to write, more similar to what you would be asked to write if you were selected as a reviewer for a journal.</p>
<p>We are keen to update them based on your feedback, so please don't hesitate to contact us with any suggestions or questions at <a href="contact@prereview.org">contact@prereview.org</a>.</p>
<h3>Template 1</h3>
<p>Below is a list of quick questions you can use to guide your reading and reviewing of the selected preprint to produce a quick review. For a more detailed template and tips, please load Template #2.  </p>
<ul>
<li>What is the main question the study attempts to answer?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What is (are) the hypothesis(es)?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What techniques/analyses do the researchers adopt to test their hypothesis(es)?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why is this study relevant?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Write here any general comments you might have about the research approach.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Write here any specific comment you might have about experimental approaches and methods used in the study.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Write here any specific comment/note about figures in the preprint (this could be related to the way data are displayed and your
ability to understand the results just by looking at the figures).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Write here any additional comment you might have (this includes minor concerns such as typos and structure of the manuscript).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Template 2</h3>
<p>Below is a detailed guide to help you critically and constructively evalute the selected preprint. For a quicker version of this guide, please select Template #1.</p>
<h4>Overview and take-home message</h4>
<p>Write a short (1 paragraph) summary of what the main findings of the research were and how this work has moved the field forward.
This could take the following structure:
“<em>[First author]</em> et al. have made significant advances in <em>[x, y and z]</em> by showing that… In addition, they have bridged the gap in
our knowledge about how <em>[process i interacts with process ii]</em>. Although this work is of <em>[significant]</em> interest to the field, there
are some concerns that could be addressed in the next version. These are outlined below.”</p>
<h4>Positive feedback</h4>
<p>As the aim of this PREreview is to support the authors by providing constructive feedback, the PREreviewer(s) should also
include positive remarks to encourage future posting of preprints. Remember, the authors are human too! To help guide you, here are a
few questions you might ask yourself after reading the preprint:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What results did you find the most interesting and why?</em>  </li>
<li><em>What did you learn from the study that really fascinated you?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Did you learn anything from this preprint that you would include in your future work? Examples could be a new technique,
a new way of approaching an idea, a certain way of interpreting the type of data, a good way of summarising the results,
the structure of the manuscript if it is clear and logical, etc.</em>  </li>
<li><em>What ideas for further research are based on the preprint? [Note: this encourages preprint authors for their early sharing
and promotes openness among reviewers as well.]</em></li>
</ul>
<h4>Concerns</h4>
<p>Next are your concerns. Remember you are writing to another human being, so be respectful and realistic. Also, if you are unsure about
something, be honest and say you are unsure. Don’t feel afraid to admit if you are not confident about your concerns, or part of the work
is out of your area of expertise.</p>
<h4>Major concerns:</h4>
<p>Here the reviewer(s) should list 2-3 major concerns about the research (if they exist). This may relate to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Does the title accurately reflect the results?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Experimental design: were the techniques appropriate for the hypothesis? Were suitable controls included?
Were new techniques/mutants/cell lines etc. sufficiently characterised to allow the study to be replicated? Were robust statistical
methods used?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Do the results support the authors’ conclusions and, if not, what additional experiments would you suggest?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Are there big flaws in the understanding of the current literature and interpretation of the literature that might undermine the
interpretation of the current results?</em>  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Minor concerns:</h4>
<p>Here the PREreviewer(s) can mention 3-5 minor concerns that are not critical to the understanding and conclusions of the research, but would improve the overall flow or clarity of the manuscript. These concerns might include the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In general, was the manuscript easy to follow/did it have a logical flow? Were there a lot of typos that needed addressing?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Does the abstract provide a concise summary of the hypotheses and main results?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Were the methods sufficiently detailed to allow the experiments to be repeated?</em>  </li>
<li>*Were the figures clear and logically arranged? Were the figure legends sufficiently detailed to allow the figures to be understood without reading the main text?</li>
<li><em>Are the figures representative of the data described in the results section?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Did the authors make all their associated data openly available (e.g. sequencing data, coding)?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Did the discussion address how their results move the field forwards?</em>  </li>
<li><em>Were the citations thorough or were key references missing?</em>  </li>
</ul>
