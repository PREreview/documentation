<h1>Live-streamed PREreview journal clubs</h1>
<p>Live-streamed preprint journal clubs are topic-centered, interactive preprint journal clubs that are live-streamed via videoconference. These events are designed to be inclusive by allowing structured and constructive discussions around preprints and encouraging diverse methods of participation. Researchers – or anyone interested in joining the discussion – from all over the world can join to build their network, meet globally-renowned experts, and collaborate on improving a preprint. We have had participation from researchers, students, publishers and artists!  </p>
<p>You can request our help to organize a live-streamed PREreview journal club by filling <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlpfxK0XEeVbUD7aHBKLf6g7rOups-uS2ZytpDKdHNBHwNZg/viewform">this form</a>.</p>
<p>Live-streamed PREreview journal clubs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Inclusive</em>: anyone, anywhere in the world with a internet or phone connection can join
</li>
<li><em>Informative</em>: you can learn more about the topic by listening to/reading the comments of other researchers in the field and even
the authors themselves (if invited)
</li>
<li><em>Efficient</em>: if preprint authors are present, they receive feedback in real time. Also, we limit the calls to 1 hour to
keep the feedback focused and the calls on time
</li>
<li><em>Collaborative</em>: the format encourages contributions from all participants regardless of participation style preference, <em>i.e.</em>, both vocal and
silent writing (etherpadding)
</li>
<li><em>Fun</em>: even though the discussions are kept professional and centered around providing constructive feedback to the preprint,
they are a fun way to meet other people interested in the field.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to get started</h2>
<ol>
<li>Choose a preprint you wish to discuss at a LivePREJC.  </li>
<li>If you can, make a list of a few other scientists or other interested professionals, preferably at different career levels and from different institutions, who you think would be interested in participating to the discussion of the chosen preprint. If you can't think of anyone to invite, don't despair... our team will help you recruit more participants.  </li>
<li>Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlpfxK0XEeVbUD7aHBKLf6g7rOups-uS2ZytpDKdHNBHwNZg/viewform">this form</a>
to request our support to run the LivePREJC. </li>
</ol>
<h2>What to expect</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Our team will help you organize the call by providing a registration form, a customed Etherpad for collaborative note-taking (example from a previous LivePRJC <a href="https://etherpad.net/p/NeuroscienceLiveStreamedPREJC">here</a>), and access to a <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> virtual room (up to 100 participants). We will also send out an email to participants who you have identified or who have signed up to participate with instructions on how to join the LivePREJC. Participants will be encouraged to read the preprint before the event, to keep the discussion short and focused. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should you desire, we will help you recruit participants by inviting people in our network and advertising the event on social media using the #LivePREJC hashtag – and any other hashtags related to the research field of the preprint discussed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One or two members of our team will facilitate the call to ensure that the conversation runs smoothly and stays on time (1 hour). During the call, we will take notes and encourage others to take notes on a collaborative Etherpad. Importantly, we will set the tone for a productive and respectful conversation according to our <a href="link">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are a preprint author, you will have the option to participate to the discussion, you will be asked to please remain in ‘listening mode’ – except when asked a question by participants - until the last 10 minutes reserved for this discussion. This will encourage participants to express their constructive feedback freely and stimulate a productive discussion. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are NOT a preprint author, we will invite you to contact the corresponding author(s) and let them know about the upcoming LivePREJC. If you don't feel comfortable doing it, please let us know and we will do it on your behalf. Letting the preprint authors know that there will be a live-streamed discussion about their preprint is not necessary, but it is recommended. You can also choose to invite them to join the call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should you desire to, we will help you format and write the prereview, and share it on the PREreview platform.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1>How to write a prereview</h1>
<p>At PREreview, we believe <em>all</em> researchers should be able to engage in honest and respectful conversations around emerging scientific
output. Peer review is a foundamental aspect of being a researcher. However, formal training in it is uncommon and varies in quality. </p>
<p>To help you with the composition of your prereview, here are 5 basic tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be respectful</li>
<li>Be constructive</li>
<li>Be honest</li>
<li>Be clear </li>
<li>Be coincise</li>
</ol>
<p>...</p>
<h3>Quick template questions:</h3>
<p>Below is a list of questions you can be asking yourself while reading the preprint to write up a quick review.  </p>
<ul>
<li><em>What is the main question the study attempts to answer?</em></li>
<li><em>What is (are) the hypothesis(es)?</em></li>
<li><em>What techniques/analyses do the researchers adopt to test their hypothesis(es)?</em></li>
<li><em>Why is this study relevant?</em></li>
<li><em>Write here any general comments you might have about the research approach.</em></li>
<li><em>Write here any specific comment you might have about experimental approaches and methods used in the study.</em></li>
<li><em>Write here any specific comment/note about figures in the paper (this could be related to the way data are displayed and your
ability to understand the results just by looking at the figures).</em></li>
<li><em>Write here any additional comment you might have (this includes minor concerns such as typos and structure of the manuscript)</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Extended peer review guidelines</h3>
<p>Use the template below to compose a full PREreview report.  </p>
<p><strong>Overview and take-home messages:</strong><br>
Write a short (1 paragraph) summary of what the main findings of the research were and how this work has moved the field forward.
This could take the following structure:<br>
<em>“[First author] et al. have made significant advances in [x, y and z] by showing that … In addition, they have bridged the gap in
our knowledge about how [process i interacts with process ii]. Although this work is of [significant] interest to the field, there
are some concerns that could be addressed in the next version. These are outlined below.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Positive feedback:</strong><br>
As the goal of the PREreview is to support the authors by providing constructive feedback, your should include positive remarks
to encourage future posting of preprints. Remember, the authors are human too! To help guide you, here are a
few questions you might keep in mind while/after reading the preprint:</p>
<ul>
<li>What result did you find the most interesting and why?  </li>
<li>What did you learn from their research that really fascinated you?</li>
<li>Did you think of any future exciting directions this research could take, or future experiments the researchers could try?
Try to include experiments that are not critical to this particular preprint but the research area in general.</li>
<li>Did you learn anything from this preprint that you would include in your future work? Examples could be a new technique, a new way
of approaching an idea, a certain way of interpreting the type of data, a good way of summarising the results, the structure of the
manuscript if it is clear and logical, etc.</li>
<li>What ideas for further research are based on the preprint? This encourages preprint authors for their early sharing and promotes
openness among reviewers as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concerns, clarification, suggestions</strong><br>
Remember you are writing to another human being, so be respectful and realistic with your comments/suggestions. Also, if you are unsure
about something, be honest and say you are unsure. This is a learning process, so don’t feel afraid to admit if you are not confident
about your concerns, or part of the work is out of your area of expertise. Finally, remember to include suggestions on how to address
the concerns.</p>
<p>Major concerns:<br>
Here you should list 2-3 major concerns about the research (if any). These may relate to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the title accurately reflect the results? </li>
<li>Were the techniques appropriate for the hypothesis? </li>
<li>Were suitable controls included? </li>
<li>Were new techniques/mutants/cell lines etc. sufficiently characterised to allow the study to be replicated? </li>
<li>Were robust statistical methods used?</li>
<li>Do the results support the authors’ conclusions and, if not, what additional experiments would you suggest?
Are there big flaws in the understanding of the current literature and interpretation of the literature that might undermine the interpretation of the current results?</li>
</ul>
<p>Minor concerns:<br>
Here you can mention 3-5 minor concerns that are not critical to the understanding and conclusions of the research, but, if addressed,
would improve the overall flow or clarity of the manuscript. These may relate to:</p>
<ul>
<li>In general, was the manuscript easy to follow/did it have a logical flow? Were there a lot of typos that needed addressing?</li>
<li>Does the abstract provide a concise summary of the hypotheses and main results?</li>
<li>Were the methods sufficiently detailed to allow the experiments to be repeated?</li>
<li>Were the figures clear and logically arranged? Were the figure legends sufficiently detailed to allow the figures to be understood without reading the main text?</li>
<li>Are the figures representative of the data described in the results section?</li>
<li>Did the authors make all their associated data openly available (e.g. sequencing data, coding)?</li>
<li>Did the discussion address how their results move the field forwards?</li>
<li>Were the citations thorough or were key references missing?</li>
</ul>
