# Live-streamed PREreview journal clubs
 
Live-streamed preprint journal clubs are topic-centered, interactive preprint journal clubs that are live-streamed via videoconference. These events are designed to be inclusive of all researchers by allowing structured and constructive discussions around preprints and encouraging diverse methods of participation. Researchers from all over the world can join to build their network, meet globally-renowned experts, and collaborate on improving a preprint. 

You can request our help to organize a live-streamed PREreview journal club by filling [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlpfxK0XEeVbUD7aHBKLf6g7rOups-uS2ZytpDKdHNBHwNZg/viewform).

Live-streamed PREreview journal clubs are:

* *Inclusive*: anyone, anywhere in the world with a internet or phone connection can join
    
* *Informative*: you can learn more about the topic by listening to/reading the comments of other researchers in the field and even 
the authors themselves (if invited)
    
* *Efficient*: if preprint authors are present, they receive feedback in real time. Also, we limit the calls to 1 hour to 
keep the feedback focused and efficient
    
* *Collaborative*: the format encourages contributions from all participants regardless of input style preference, *i.e.*, both vocal and 
silent writing (etherpadding)
    
* *Fun*: even though the discussions are kept professional and centered around providing constructive feedback to the preprint, 
they are a fun way to meet other people interested in the field.

## How to get started

1. Choose a preprint you wish to discuss at a LivePREJC.  
    
2. If you can, make a list of a few other scientists or other interested professionals, preferably at different career levels and from different institutions, who you think would be interested in participating to the discussion of the chosen preprint. If you can't think of anyone to invite, don't despair... our team will help you recruit more participants.  
  
3. Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlpfxK0XEeVbUD7aHBKLf6g7rOups-uS2ZytpDKdHNBHwNZg/viewform) 
to request our support to run the LivePREJC. 


## What to expect

1. Our team will help you organize the call by providing a registration form, a customed Etherpad for collaborative note-taking (example from a previous LivePRJC [here](https://etherpad.net/p/NeuroscienceLiveStreamedPREJC)), and access to a [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) virtual room (up to 100 participants). We will also send out an email to participants who either you have identified or who signed up to participate with instructions on how to join the LivePREJC. Participants will be encouraged to read the preprint before the event, to keep the discussion short and focused. 

2. Should you desire to, we will help you recruit participants by inviting people in our network and advertising the event on social media using the #LivePREJC hashtag – and any other hashtags related to the research field of the preprint discussed.

3. One or two members of our team will facilitate the call to ensure that the conversation runs smoothly and stays on time (1 hour). During the call, we will take notes and encourage others to take notes on a collaborative Etherpad. Importantly, we will set the tone for a productive and respectful conversation according to our [Code of Conduct](link).

4. If you are a preprint author, you will have the option to participate to the discussion, you will be asked to please remain in ‘listening mode’ – except when asked a question by participants - until the last 10 minutes reserved for this discussion. This will encourage participants to express their constructive feedback freely and stimulate a productive discussion. 

5. If are NOT a preprint author, we will invite you to contact the corresponding author(s) and let them know about the upcoming LivePREJC. If you don't feel comfortable doing it, please let us know and we will do it on your behalf. Letting the preprint authors know that there will be a live-streamed discussion about their preprint is not necessary, but it is recommended. You can also choose to invite them to join the call.

6. Should you desire to, we will help you format and write the prereview, and share it on the PREreview platform.
