# How to write a PREreview

At PREreview, we believe *all* researchers should be able to engage in honest and respectful conversations around emerging scientific 
output. Peer review is a foundamental aspect of being a researcher. However, formal training in it is uncommon and varies in quality.

To help you with the composition of your PREreview, here are 5 basic tips:

1. Be respectful
2. Be constructive
3. Be honest
4. Be clear 
5. Be coincise

...

### Quick template questions:
Below is a list of questions you can be asking yourself while reading the perprint.  

* *What is the main question the study attempts to answer?*
* *What is (are) the hypothesis(es)?*
* *What techniques/analyses do the researchers adopt to test their hypothesis(es)?*
* *Why is this study relevant?*
* *Write here any general comments you might have about the research approach.*
* *Write here any specific comment you might have about experimental approaches and methods used in the study.*
* *Write here any specific comment/note about figures in the paper (this could be related to the way data are displayed and your 
ability to understand the results just by looking at the figures).*
* *Write here any additional comment you might have (this includes minor concerns such as typos and structure of the manuscript)*

### Extended peer review guidelines  
Use the template below to compose a full PREreview report.  

**Overview and take-home messages:**  
Write a short (1 paragraph) summary of what the main findings of the research were and how this work has moved the field forward. 
This could take the following structure:  
*“[First author] et al. have made significant advances in [x, y and z] by showing that … In addition, they have bridged the gap in 
our knowledge about how [process i interacts with process ii]. Although this work is of [significant] interest to the field, there 
are some concerns that could be addressed in the next version. These are outlined below.”*

**Positive feedback:**  
As the goal of the PREreview is to support the authors by providing constructive feedback, your should include positive remarks 
to encourage future posting of preprints. Remember, the authors are human too! To help guide you, here are a 
few questions you might keep in mind while/after reading the preprint:

* What result did you find the most interesting and why?  
* What did you learn from their research that really fascinated you?
* Did you think of any future exciting directions this research could take, or future experiments the researchers could try? 
Try to include experiments that are not critical to this particular preprint but the research area in general.
* Did you learn anything from this preprint that you would include in your future work? Examples could be a new technique, a new way 
of approaching an idea, a certain way of interpreting the type of data, a good way of summarising the results, the structure of the 
manuscript if it is clear and logical, etc.
* What ideas for further research are based on the preprint? This encourages preprint authors for their early sharing and promotes 
openness among reviewers as well.

**Concerns, clarification, suggestions**  
Remember you are writing to another human being, so be respectful and realistic with your comments/suggestions. Also, if you are unsure 
about something, be honest and say you are unsure. This is a learning process, so don’t feel afraid to admit if you are not confident 
about your concerns, or part of the work is out of your area of expertise. Finally, remember to include suggestions on how to address 
the concerns.

Major concerns:  
Here you should list 2-3 major concerns about the research (if any). These may relate to:

* Does the title accurately reflect the results? 
* Were the techniques appropriate for the hypothesis? 
* Were suitable controls included? 
* Were new techniques/mutants/cell lines etc. sufficiently characterised to allow the study to be replicated? 
* Were robust statistical methods used?
* Do the results support the authors’ conclusions and, if not, what additional experiments would you suggest?
    Are there big flaws in the understanding of the current literature and interpretation of the literature that might undermine the interpretation of the current results?

Minor concerns:  
Here you can mention 3-5 minor concerns that are not critical to the understanding and conclusions of the research, but, if addressed,
would improve the overall flow or clarity of the manuscript. These may relate to:

* In general, was the manuscript easy to follow/did it have a logical flow? Were there a lot of typos that needed addressing?
* Does the abstract provide a concise summary of the hypotheses and main results?
* Were the methods sufficiently detailed to allow the experiments to be repeated?
* Were the figures clear and logically arranged? Were the figure legends sufficiently detailed to allow the figures to be understood without reading the main text?
* Are the figures representative of the data described in the results section?
* Did the authors make all their associated data openly available (e.g. sequencing data, coding)?
* Did the discussion address how their results move the field forwards?
* Were the citations thorough or were key references missing?

You can find additional peer review tips in the [PLOS Reviewer Center](http://reviewers.plos.org/), including their 
[How To Peer Review](http://reviewers.plos.org/resources/#how-to-review page that contains [10 Tips for 
getting started as a reviewer](http://reviewers.plos.org/resources/10-tips-for-getting-started-as-a-reviewer/). 
These resources include checklists, videos, and further information about ethical considerations etc. 
They also provide suggested language you can use to address common issues that can arise when reviewing a manuscript.
