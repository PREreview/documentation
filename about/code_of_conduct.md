# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge  
In the interest of fostering an open and  welcoming environment we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to making participation 
in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender 
identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We believe it is our duty as scientists at any level of our career to contribute to scientific evaluation in the form of peer review. 
PREreview provides a space for any researcher, independently of their career level, to provide feedback to emerging scientific output. We strive to build and support a community of PREreviewers who provide constructive feedback, because we are convinced that one can be honest AND respectful at the same time.  

## Our Responsibilities  
The PREreview team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair 
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.  

The PREreview team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, and other contributions that are not aligned 
to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, 
threatening, offensive, or harmful. 

This Code of Conduct applies to PREreview members contributing directly on this platform or participating to events organized by 
PREreview (workshop, live preprint journal clubs, community calls, etc.).

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting project leads at contact@prereview.org. 
This includes a rude and/or destructive comment appearing in a PREreview. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will 
result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The PREreview team is obligated to maintain 
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
PREreview members who do not follow and PREreview team members who do not enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary 
or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

### Example behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

### Examples of unacceptable behaviors by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

This Code of Conduct was adapted from the [Contributor Covenant, version 1.4](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html).
