# Live-streamed PREreview journal clubs
 
At PREreview, we want to take preprint journal clubs to the next level. Live-streamed PREreview journal clubs (LivePREJCs) are 
hosted via online community calls, allowing anyone with internet or phone-in capabilities to join the discussion. 
This format promotes inclusivity by following a structure that provides a means to join the discussion silently in written 
form and vocally. You can request our help to organize a live-streamed preprint journal club by clicking on the link above and filling the form. Here is a list of current and past LivePREJCs.

Live-streamed PREreview journal clubs are:

* *Inclusive*: anyone, anywhere in the world with a internet or phone connection can join
    
* *Informative*: you can learn more about the topic by listening to/reading the comments of other researchers in the field and even 
the authors themselves (if invited)
    
* *Efficient*: if preprint authors are present, they receive feedback in real time. Also, we restrict the live journal clubs to 1 hour to 
keep the feedback focused and efficient
    
* *Collaborative*: the format encourages contributions from all participants regardless of input style preference, *i.e.*, both vocal and 
silent writing (etherpadding)
    
* *Fun*: even though the discussions are kept professional and centered around providing constructive feedback to the preprint authors, 
they are a fun way to meet other people interested in the field.

#### How to get started:

1. Choose a preprint you wish to discuss at a LivePREJC (find out more about what preprints are and where to find them).  
    
2. Find a few other scientists or researchers, preferably at different career levels and from different institutions, 
who would like to participate in the LivePREJC. Our team will help you recruit more participants if you cannot find them on your own.  
  
3. Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlpfxK0XEeVbUD7aHBKLf6g7rOups-uS2ZytpDKdHNBHwNZg/viewform) 
to formally request a LivePREJC and our logistic support. 

4. If you are not the preprint author(s), you can contact the corresponding author(s) and let them know about the LivePREJC. 
If you don't feel comfortable doing this, please let us know and we will do it on your behalf. You can also choose not to 
include the author(s) in the discussion. 

#### What to expect during the call:

LivePREJCs are hosted by one or two members of the PREreview team: we will ensure that the conversation around the preprint runs 
smoothly and stays on time (1 hour); they will take notes and encourage others to take notes on a collaborative etherpad (see below); 
importantly, they will set the tone for a productive and respectful conversation according to the PREreview code-of-conduct.

Preprint authors interested in having their preprint discussed on a LivePREJC, will have the option to be present (recommended). 
We advise authors to find 5-10 participants (not all the participants need to be experts in the field). Our team will help 
coordinate the call and, if the authors request it, help recruit more researchers in the field by advertising the call on social 
media using the #LivePREJC hashtag and any other hashtag related to the research field of the preprint discussed.
    
Once the preprint authors have identified the participants, we will send out a short email with instructions on how to join the 
LivePREJC and with a copy of the preprint. Participants will be encouraged to read the preprint before the LivePREJC, to keep 
the discussion short and focused.Authors will be asked to remain in ‘listening mode’ – except when asked a question by participants - until the last 10 minutes reserved for this discussion. This will encourage participants to express their constructive feedback freely and stimulate a productive discussion.

Participants will be given the opportunity to give feedback both vocally (with notes taken by one of the PREreview team) and in 
written form (via collaborative note-taking on a public etherpad that we will set up for each LivePREJC). Here is an example of an 
etherpad template that will be used for the LivePREJCs.
