# Our Mission
PREreview seeks to diversify peer review in the academic community by crowdsourcing feedback to preprints to improve the 
quality of published scientific output, and to train early-career researchers (ECRs) in how to review other's work.

## Why preprints?
Over the past 30 years, publishing in the biological sciences has become a much lengthier process<sup>1</sup>. One way to separate 
the sharing of scientific outputs from quality evaluation expressed purely by the opinions of publishers and a few peers, is posting 
your manuscript as a preprint. 

[Preprints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zMgY8Dx9co) are early, yet complete, versions of scientific manuscripts made freely available online before journal-organized peer review. 
They are often the same manuscripts that are submitted to a journal for peer review, but are stored on freely accessible public servers such that 
they become available to the whole web community within 1-2 days from submission.  

Preprints offer multiple opportunities to both train and diversify the pool of peer reviewers:  
1) Research is available immediately, instead of being delayed for months; 2) community peer review allows for the feedback of a 
larger and more diverse pool of experts;  
3) Writing and sharing reviews helps train early-career researchers in the norms of constructive peer review;  
4) As citable objects, preprints and their reviews can be used as proof of productivity and engagement for career advancement. 

## Why training researchers in peer review?

* __Formal peer review training is rare and variable in quality__  
In our community opinion survey<sup>2</sup>, we found that only 18% of the respondents had received peer review training, even 
though 72% had contributed to the peer review process. This suggests that very few scientists are trained when they write their 
first review – and even when they are, the training may vary greatly in quality. This is not only worrisome for journal editors because 
they will find it harder to recruit new qualified reviewers, but it also denies ECRs the opportunity to learn valuable critical thinking 
skills from the early stages of their scientific training. Furthermore, ECRs are rarely invited to engage in traditional peer review. This is likely because they are either not known to journal editors or 
they are believed to be less competent than more senior researchers at providing feedback on their peers’ work. 

* __Expand and diversify the pool of peer reviewers__  
The current system of scientific peer review is flawed. Research is evaluated by a handful of 
unpaid reviewers selected by journal editors as “experts” in the field. Two or sometimes three reviewers are chosen opaquely, often 
through personal connections. Behind closed doors, they decide the fate of a research article, largely basing their evaluation on 
subjective criteria. Paradoxically, while peer review is a key component for scientific dissemination, very few scientists receive 
any formal training in it. 

  This arcane process is not only slow and inefficient – with waiting periods from submission to publication of six months or more – 
  but also disadvantages researchers from under-represented groups or under-resourced institutions. When they submit their research for 
  peer review, their work is evaluated using standards developed for research groups with vastly more resources and connections. 
  The gatekeepers to publication are disproportionately male<sup>3,4,5</sup> and from the U.S. or Europen countries<sup>6</sup>. Rarely is research 
  evaluated by a diverse pool of reviewers who can provide a comprehensive and context-appropriate evaluation of the science. 
  
  Thus, we need better ways to find, train, and engage researchers in peer review, and, importantly, we need to be intentional about including 
  researchers from under-represented groups in the design and leadership on any potential solutions. 

At PREreview, we are dedicated to training a diverse community of reviewers, monitoring their progress and impact on the future of 
peer review. How will we achieve this goal? 

* __Cohort-based peer review mentorship program (coming soon)__  
We are developing a cohort-based peer-review mentorship program based on the successful 
[Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/). Researchers with little to no experience 
in peer review will be paired with more experienced reviewers and invited to engage in community calls, webinars, and one-to-one calls. 
The curriculum includes critical evaluation of preprints, strategies to help researchers provide constructive feedback, and training in unconscious bias, licensing, and leadership. 

  We are currently working with our community to learn how this program can support researchers from under-represented groups. If you are 
  interested in learning more, be considered as a mentor or a mentee in our first cohort, or give us suggestions on how to best achieve our
  goal, please email us at contact@prereview.org.

* __Live-streamed preprint journal clubs__  
We are implementing live-streamed preprint journal clubs, topic-centered, interactive preprint journal clubs that are 
live-streamed via videoconference. These events are designed to be inclusive of all researchers by allowing structured and 
constructive discussions around preprints and encouraging diverse methods of participation. Researchers from all over the world 
can join to build their network, meet globally-renowned experts, and collaborate on improving a preprint. Learn more about this program
