Daniela is a Mozilla Fellow for Science 2018/2019. At PREreview she leads the development of the platform and is 
responsible for fundraising and the sustainability of the project. Daniela has recently earned a Ph.D. in neuroscience at 
Oregon Health and Science University, in Portland OR, USA. During her time as a student, she became increasingly interested in how 
open practices can be used to empower early-career researchers in taking ownership over their work, and to facilitate collaborations 
within and across teams. Daniela enjoys cooking and eating good vegetarian food (she is Italian, after all!), rock climbing, and reading 
biographies and up-lifting books with her two black cats on her lap.


### Samantha Hindle, Ph.D. – Co-founder, Peer Review Training and Parterships Lead

Monica joined the PREreview team in January 2018, first as a member of the Advisory Committee, and then as the lead of community building and 
outreach. She is a Mitacs Canadian Science Policy Fellow working as Policy Analyst at Environment and Climate Change Canada in open science. 
As a food web ecologist, she has been dedicated to using the current knowledge around food webs to monitor changes in freshwater 
systems and, most importantly, to provide recommendations to decision makers and the public. Monica is a story-teller and teaches other
scientists how to use improv skills as a way to better communicate their science.
